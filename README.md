## Scope
+ This policy applies to all HackLab members, officers, directors and guests.
+ This policy describes the organization’s objectives, policies and remedy regarding maintaining a harassment free culture and safe environment that protects human rights and dignity.
+ This policy aims to encompass all aspects of harassment such as but not limited to those defined by the Prohibited Grounds.
+ This policy serves to augment and extend upon existing Canadian and Provincial laws providing HackLab membership with a richer expectation of conduct and community quality.
+ This policy also aims to outline remedial and disciplinary action as well as the handling of incidents where this policy applies.
+ This policy empowers members to seek remedy to abuse, assault and human rights violations through due process.
+ This policy ensures that Human Rights are observed, respected and enforced in a just manner with education and understanding.

## Notwithstanding
This Policy was not designed to suppress discussion or inhibit people from speaking honestly.  Nor is it designed to foster an environment where one feels they are “walking on eggshells” with everyday conversation and/or interaction.  People should feel free to have conversation, discussion and discourse as well as civil arguments about difficult and charged subject matter.  

At times these charged discussions can take a turn into disrespectful name-calling and/or strong language; situations which fall within that context do not as a rule constitute harassment but are an unfortunate result of passionate disagreement.  In those situations, allow cooler heads to prevail and use methods of informal resolution as outlined in the Preamble section of this Policy.  

This Policy shall not be used as a means to silence dissent, discussion or the various other types of debate aforementioned.  The balance and consideration in determining if a complaint falls under this Policy shall be deemed to be a matter of community standards and appropriate Canadian Law.

## Preamble
+ People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
+ The first steps before invoking remedy through the Policy should be by informal resolution between the involved parties.
+ The goal of both informal resolution and the formal complaint processes is to resolve situations of alleged prohibited conduct as soon as possible, in a fair, constructive and respectful manner.
+ We strongly encourage anyone who feels harassed to talk to the alleged harasser about the situation, the alleged harasser should hear the complainant out and that ensure that their attitude and behaviour reflect a commitment to resolution and one of respect.
+ Some suggestions for informal dispute resolution are
 - Meet in a quiet location, without interruptions.
 - Treat the issue seriously.
 - Keep in mind that the complainant may feel vulnerable.
 - Listen carefully and patiently; be non-judgmental.
 - Resist letting your own emotions, past experience or the reputation of any party influence your objectivity.
 - Resist the temptation to solve the problem impulsively or to make rash decisions; let cooler heads prevail.
+ In the vast majority of cases, using informal resolution such as dialogue or mediation by another HackLab member can offer the possibility of resolving the conflict in a satisfactory manner acceptable to both parties.
+ It is within the HackLab community interests to empower members to focus on solution orientated and respectful conflict resolution such that this Policy may not require invocation.
+ If you do not feel that you have the ability to implement any of the methods suggested for informal resolution but wish for an informal resolution, do not hesitate to seek out the assistance of a trusted fellow member or a member of the Board.
